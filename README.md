# GenAI_Hackathon_Finance_Chatbot by team M2

The Personal Finance Chatbot is an AI-powered assistant built using IBM Watson and Granite models to help users manage their finances effectively. It can track expenses, analyze spending patterns, generate reports, and answer finance-related queries—all through a simple conversational interface. Designed to be lightweight and fast, the chatbot can run locally through command-line interaction without requiring additional hardware.

This project is developed by a team of two eager students dedicated to building intelligent and practical AI-driven tools.
